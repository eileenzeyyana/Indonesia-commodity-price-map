# Indonesia-commodity-price-map
Interactive map visualizing commodity prices across Indonesian provinces (2022-2024)
This project is an original academic work developed independently by Eileen Zeyyana Shinta, an International Undergraduate Program student in the Department of Geodetic Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Class of 2023. The design, implementation, analysis, and visualization presented in this project were conceived and executed by the author as part of an academic assignment in spatial programming.

The project utilizes publicly available datasets and open-source software libraries solely as supporting resources. Commodity price data are obtained from the open-access Indonesia Commodity Price dataset published on Kaggle, which was compiled by Muhammad Fathur Rizky, Guntara Hambali, and Adhimas Aryo Bimo. The original dataset sources include the National Food Agency of Indonesia (Badan Pangan Nasional), Yahoo Finance, Investing.com, and Google Trends, as documented by the dataset authors. The dataset is used in its published form, and no claims of authorship over the original data collection are made.

Spatial boundary data for Indonesian provinces are sourced from publicly available shapefiles provided by indonesia-geospasial.com. Basemap data are provided by OpenStreetMap contributors under the Open Database License (ODbL).

All data preprocessing, aggregation, spatial integration, analytical workflows, and interactive map visualizations were developed independently by the author using Python-based geospatial libraries, including pandas, geopandas, and folium. No proprietary code or unpublished materials were used in this project.

Any external libraries, datasets, or tools employed in this project are properly cited in the documentation. This work does not reproduce or closely replicate existing projects, tutorials, or repositories, and any conceptual or technical inspiration drawn from public resources has been substantially adapted and extended within an original analytical framework.

This statement is provided to affirm compliance with academic integrity policies and to clearly distinguish between original contributions and the use of openly licensed data and software.
